# Advent Of Code 2020

To run any of the code ensure you have .NET 5 installed by either downloading Visual Studio v16.8 or greater, or install the .NET SDK v5.0.100 or greater.

## Running Code
I'm writing most of the setup code in an F# Script ([Runners.fsx](/AdventOfCode/Runners.fsx)) and running it via the F# Immediate Window in Visual Studio.

## Testing Code
To test the code, go to the *AdventOfCode* directory and run ```dotnet test```.
