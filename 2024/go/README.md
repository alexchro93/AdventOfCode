# Introduction

This directory contains my `go` solutions to Advent Of Code 2024. I am taking this
year's challenge as an opportunity to learn some basic `go`.

## Setup

I have installed `go` version 1.23.3 on Windows 11: https://go.dev/dl/go1.23.3.windows-amd64.msi

## Running The Code

To run a specific day's solution you can use the following command. Make sure you're in directory `AdvenOfCode/2024/go`.

```PowerShell
go run . 1
```

This example computes my solution to both parts of day one's challenge. Replace '1' in the above command with any day for which I've written a solution, and the code should output some answer (no guarantee they're correct).
